- WBS Ref: 1.1
- Title: Implement shared governance and policy decision core
- Area: 1-0
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Runtime Status: pending

## Scope
Route CLI/API/UI/agent actions through one deterministic transition and policy pipeline. Output: shared decision envelope and parity tests.

## Purpose
Route CLI/API/UI/agent actions through one deterministic transition and policy pipeline.

## Preconditions
- P5-00-CONTRACT-BASELINE complete

## Required Inputs
- /mnt/c/Users/User/Downloads/Substrate_Phase5_Master_PRD.md

## Required Actions
- Route CLI/API/UI/agent actions through one deterministic transition and policy pipeline. Output: shared decision envelope and parity tests.

## Required Outputs
- Evidence artifacts for P5-01-GOVERNANCE-POLICY-CORE

## Validation Checks
- Run packet-scoped tests/commands for P5-01-GOVERNANCE-POLICY-CORE
- Record evidence paths and validation output for P5-01-GOVERNANCE-POLICY-CORE

## Exit Criteria
- Packet P5-01-GOVERNANCE-POLICY-CORE meets scope, validation, and evidence requirements

## Halt Conditions
- Dependency or contract prerequisites unresolved
- Deterministic governance invariants violated

## Dependency Context
