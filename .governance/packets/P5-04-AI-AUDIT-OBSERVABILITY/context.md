# Packet Context Bundle: P5-04-AI-AUDIT-OBSERVABILITY

## Packet Summary
- ID: P5-04-AI-AUDIT-OBSERVABILITY
- WBS Ref: 1.4
- Title: Implement AI execution observability and immutable audit events
- Area: 1-0
- Priority: MEDIUM
- Runtime Status: pending

## Scope
Capture execution, policy, token, and constraint telemetry with immutable logging. Output: event schema and metrics instrumentation.

## Purpose
Capture execution, policy, token, and constraint telemetry with immutable logging.

## Preconditions
- P5-03-BUDGET-RAG-STRUCTURED-OUTPUT complete

## Required Inputs
- /mnt/c/Users/User/Downloads/Substrate_Phase5_Master_PRD.md

## Required Actions
- Capture execution, policy, token, and constraint telemetry with immutable logging. Output: event schema and metrics instrumentation.

## Required Outputs
- Evidence artifacts for P5-04-AI-AUDIT-OBSERVABILITY

## Validation Checks
- Run packet-scoped tests/commands for P5-04-AI-AUDIT-OBSERVABILITY
- Record evidence paths and validation output for P5-04-AI-AUDIT-OBSERVABILITY

## Exit Criteria
- Packet P5-04-AI-AUDIT-OBSERVABILITY meets scope, validation, and evidence requirements

## Halt Conditions
- Dependency or contract prerequisites unresolved
- Deterministic governance invariants violated

## Dependency Context
- Depends on: none
- Dependents: none

## Recent Events
- none

## Execution Steps
1. Claim packet if not in_progress.
2. Implement only scoped changes.
3. Validate using packet-specific checks.
4. Mark done with evidence and residual risk acknowledgement.
